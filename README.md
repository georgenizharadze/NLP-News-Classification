## My Capstone project with Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

In this project, I perform Natural Language Processing for feature engineering and build a classificaiton model for the recognition of ideological belonging of news feeds. Detailed description is present in the PDF file, "report.pdf". The code can be examined and run per instructions below. 

### Instructions

The main code is present in Jupyter Notebook capstone.ipynb.The code is built in Python 3. The environment (yaml) file is included in the repository. To create the environment, download the file and run the command:

`conda env create -f NLP_environment.yaml` 

One more custom-made library, visuals.py, is also required and is enclosed in the repository.
